# MTG_app
 Refining my skills and teaching myself new ones by creating an application to review magic the gathering cards. Follow my journey here!

# Preface
This is my attempt to combine the two things I love most in the world: Python and Magic The Gathering. I want to use this application to push myself in pursuit of knowledge (and gain the attention of Wizards of the Coast). 

So often, MTG players, both new and old, go to build or tweak their decks and can't find that perfect card to synergize with their deck properly. I wanted to fix that for myself and anyone else who might wish for better too. So, join me on this journey and we will be in a world of pure card synergy!

# Week 1
As of now, we have created a class for handling the datasets. from wrangling and cleaning, to dropping columns for modeling. A lot of reflecting on code this week while taking great strides to keep code reproducible and reusable.

# Next steps:
* Taking the description column and tokenizing it. SpaCy is my library of choice for now on this.
* We may house the datasets in a database. What would this look like and what platform would be best?
* Decide on the model, imputer, encoder, and metrics
